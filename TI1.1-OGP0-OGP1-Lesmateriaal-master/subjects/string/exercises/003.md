>> ### Exercise string-3: Last character
>> 
>> Create a program that asks for the user's name and gives the last character.
>> 
>>```output
>> Type your name: Paul
>> Last character: l
>>```
>>
>>```java
>> Type your name: Catherine
>> Last character: e
>>```
>>
>> **Note!** Your program should be structured so that you put the search for the last character in its own method: `public static char lastCharacter(String text)`. The tests will be testing both the method `lastCharacter` and the program overall.
