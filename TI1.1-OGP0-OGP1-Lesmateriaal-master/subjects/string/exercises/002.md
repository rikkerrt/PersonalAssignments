>> ### Exercise string-2: First character
>>
>> Create a program that asks for the user's name and gives the first character.
>> 
>>```output
>> Type your name: ~~Paul~~
>> First character: P
>>```
>>
>>```output
>> Type your name: ~~Catherine~~
>> First character: C
>>```
>>
>> **Note!** Your program should be structured so that you put the search for the first character in its own method: public static char `firstCharacter(String text)`. The tests will be testing both the method `firstCharacter` and the program overall
