>> ### Exercise string-1: The length of a name
>> 
>> Create a program that asks for the user's name and says how many characters the name contains.
>> 
>>```output
>> Type your name: ~~Paul~~
>> Number of characters: 4
>>```
>>
>>```output
>> Type your name: ~~Catherine~~
>> Number of characters: 9
>>```
>>
>> **Note!** Your program should be structured so that you put the calculating of the name length in it's own method: `public static int calculateCharacters(String text)`. The tests will be testing both the method `calculateCharacters` and the program overall.
