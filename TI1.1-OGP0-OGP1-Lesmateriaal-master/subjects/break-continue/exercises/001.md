>>### Exercise break-continue-1: Loops, ending and remembering
>>
>>This set of exercises will form one larger program when put together. We create the program by adding features exercise by exercise. If you do not finish all the exercises you can still send them to be reviewed by the exercise robot. To do that, click the "submit" button, which has a picture of an arrow and is located on the right of the testing button. Even though the exercise robot complains about tests in the incomplete exercises, you will still get points for the parts you have completed.
>>
>>**Note**: from now on every sub-exercise of a larger exercise (like 36.1) has the same value as an exercise without sub-exercises. It means that exercise 36 as a whole corresponds to five normal exercises.
>>
>> #### Exercise break-continue-1.1: Reading numbers
>>
>> Create a program that asks the user to input numbers (integers). The program prints "Type numbers” until the user types the number -1. When the user types the number -1, the program prints "Thank you and see you later!" and ends.
>>
>>```output
>>Type numbers:
>>~~5~~
>>~~2~~
>>~~4~~
>>~~-1~~
>>Thank you and see you later!
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise break-continue-1.2: The sum of the numbers
>>
>>Develop your number reading program by adding the following feature: the program should print the sum of the numbers entered by the user (without the number -1).
>>
>>```output
>>Type numbers:
>>~~5~~
>>~~2~~
>>~~4~~
>>~~-1~~
>>Thank you and see you later!
>>The sum is 11
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise break-continue-1.3: Summing and counting the numbers
>>
>>Develop your number reading and summing program by adding the following feature: the program should print how many numbers the user typed (without the number -1).
>>
>>```output
>>Type numbers:
>>~~5~~
>>~~2~~
>>~~4~~
>>~~-1~~
>>Thank you and see you later!
>>The sum is 11
>>How many numbers: 3
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise break-continue-1.4: Counting the average
>>
>>Develop your number reading, summing and counting program by adding the following feature: the program should print the average of the numbers the user typed (without the number -1).
>>
>>```output
>>Type numbers:
>>~~5~~
>>~~2~~
>>~~4~~
>>~~-1~~
>>Thank you and see you later!
>>The sum is 11
>>How many numbers: 3
>>Average: 3.666666666666
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise break-continue-1.5: Even and odd numbers
>>
>> Develop your program by adding the following feature: the program should print the number of even and odd numbers that the user typed (without the number -1).
>>
>>```output
>>Type numbers:
>>~~5~~
>>~~2~~
>>~~4~~
>>~~-1~~
>>Thank you and see you later!
>>The sum is 11
>>How many numbers: 3
>>Average: 3.666666666666
>>Even numbers: 2
>>Odd numbers: 1
>>```
