>> ### Exercise specializing-classes-1: People
>>
>> We've seen a lot of `Person` classes so far. In this exercise we're going to work on printing different kinds of students, and reusing existing code. We will start off with a `Person` class, that stores a name and age. Then we'll extend this class for `Student`s and `Teacher`s, and add extra functionality
>>
>> #### specializing-classes-1.1 Person class
>> 
>> Write a class `Person` with the attributes `String name` and `int age`. Also add the constructor `public Person(String name, int age)`
>> 
>> #### specializing-classes-1.2 Printing a person
>>
>> Add a method `printPerson` to the `Person` class that prints the name and age of this person
>>
>> ```java
>> public static void main(String[] args) {
>>    Person person = new Person("John Doe", 35);
>>    person.printPerson();
>> }
>> ```
>>
>> ```output
>> Name: John Doe
>> Age: 35
>> ```
>> 
>> #### specializing-classes-1.3 Extending the Person to a student
>> 
>> Make a new class `Student`, that extends the `Person` class and adds an attribute `int studentNumber`. Also add the constructor `public Student(String name, int age, int studentNumber)`
>>
>> #### specializing-classes-1.4 Adding a student printing method
>>
>> Add a method `printStudent` to the `Student` class that prints the name, age and student number of this person
>>
>> ```java
>> public static void main(String[] args) {
>>    Student student = new Student("John Doe", 35, 1337);
>>    student.printStudent();
>> }
>> ```
>>
>> ```output
>> Name: John Doe
>> Age: 35
>> Student number: 1337
>> ```
>>
>> **Make sure you reuse the code of the `printPerson()` method in the `printStudent` method. do not copy/paste the code from `Person` to `Student`**
