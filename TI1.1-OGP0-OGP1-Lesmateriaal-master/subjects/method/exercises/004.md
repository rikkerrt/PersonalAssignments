>> ![like a boss](images/4_likeaboss.png?right)
>>#### Exercise method-4.1: Printing stars and whitespaces
>>
>>Create a method `printWhitespaces(int size)` that prints the given amount of whitespaces. The method should not print a line break.
>>
>>Reimplement or copy the method `printStars(int size)` from the previous exercise. Make sure this method prints a line break (newline)
>>
>>#### Exercise method-4.2: Printing a right-aligned triangle
>>
>>Create the method `printTriangle(int size)` that prints a triangle using the methods `printWhitespaces` and `printStars`. Note: do not print anything in the method itself, just call the helper methods to do the actual printing.
>>
>>For example, the method call `printTriangle(4)` has the following output:
>>
>>```output
>>    *
>>   **
>>  ***
>> ****
>>```
>>#### Exercise method-4.3: Printing a Christmas tree
>>
>>Create the method xmasTree(int height) that prints a Christmas tree using the methods `printWhitespaces` and `printStars`. A Christmas tree consists of a triangle of given height and a stand. The stand is two stars tall and three stars wide and it is located in the center of the bottom of the triangle. **Note**: do not print anything in the method itself, just call the helper methods to do the actual printing.
>>
>>The method call xmasTree(4), for example, has the following output:
>>
>>```output
>>    *
>>   ***
>>  *****
>> *******
>>   ***
>>   ***
>>```
>>
>>The method call `xmasTree(10)` has the following output:
>>
>>```output
>>          *
>>         ***
>>        *****
>>       *******
>>      *********
>>     ***********
>>    *************
>>   ***************
>>  *****************
>> *******************
>>         ***
>>         ***
>>```
>>*Second note*: You don't need to worry about heights below 3!
