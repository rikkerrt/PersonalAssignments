>> ### Exercise method-6: A text-based user interface for the Hangman game
>>
>> Your friend has programmed a Hangman game for you, but the game lacks the user inferface. The Hangman has the following methods:
>>
>> * `hangman.gameOn()`  
>>   Shows if the game is on
>> * `hangman.printStatus()`  
>> Prints the game status. Shows how many guesses have been made and the letters that have not been used yet.
>> * `hangman.printWord()`  
>>   Prints the word the user tries to guess. The letters that have not been guessed yet are hidden as question marks, like "v?ri?ble".
>> * `hangman.printMan()`  
>>   Prints the Hangman.
>> * `hangman.guess(String letter)`  
>>   Guesses the letter that is given as a parameter.
>>
>> You will get a program body from the exercise robot. It already contains some functionalities:
>>
>>```java
>>         Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
>>         Hangman hangman = new Hangman();
>>
>>         System.out.println("************");
>>         System.out.println("* Hangman *");
>>         System.out.println("************");
>>         System.out.println("");
>>         printMenu();
>>         System.out.println("");
>>
>>         // ADD YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE
>>
>>     System.out.println("Thank you for playing!");
>>```
>>
>> In addition to the program body, you will get the method called printMenu:
>>
>>```java
>>     public static void printMenu() {
>>         System.out.println(" * menu *");
>>         System.out.println("quit   - quits the game");
>>         System.out.println("status  - prints the game status");
>>         System.out.println("a single letter uses the letter as a guess");
>>         System.out.println("an empty line prints this menu");
>>     }
>>```
>>
>> The exercise is completed in small steps.
>>
>> #### Exercise method-6.1: Loops and ending loops
>>
>> Create a loop in the program that works as a base for the rest of the user interface. Ask the user to submit the command inside the loop. If the command is "quit", break the loop.
>>
>> Use the command `hangman.gameOn` as the condition for the while structure. The loop should look like:
>>
>>```java
>> while (hangman.gameOn()) {
>>     String command = reader.nextLine();
>>     // ...
>> }
>>```
>>
>> In the next set (week) of exercises, we will find out what this peculiar-looking condition for ending the loop is about.
>>
>> This far the program should produce the following output:
>>
>>```output
>> ************
>> * Hangman *
>> ************
>>
>>  * menu *
>> quit   - quits the game
>> status - prints the game status
>> a single letter uses the letter as a guess
>> an empty line prints this menu
>>
>> Type a command:
>> do not quit
>>
>> Type a command:
>> quit
>> Thank you for playing!
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-6.2: Printing the status
>>
>> If the user gives the command "status", print the status using the method `hangman.printStatus()`.
>>
>>```output
>> ************
>> * Hangman *
>> ************
>>
>> * menu *
>> quit   - quits the game
>> status - prints the game status
>> a single letter uses the letter as a guess
>> an empty line prints this menu
>>
>> Type a command:
>> status
>> You have not made any guesses yet.
>> Unused letters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
>>
>> Type a command:
>> quit
>> Thank you for playing!
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-6.3: Making a guess
>>
>> If the user types in a single letter as a command, use it to make a guess. Guessing a letter occurs in the method `hangman.guess(command)`. The guessing command has its own printing functionality, which it uses to print more information about the guess.
>>
>> Hint: finding out if the command is a single letter is done as follows:
>>
>>```java
>> String command = reader.nextLine();
>>
>> if(command.length() == 1) {  // command has only one letter, so it must be a guess
>>     hangman.guess(command);
>> }
>>```
>>
>>```output
>> ...
>> Type a command:
>> a
>> The letter a is not in the word.
>>
>> Type a command:
>> b
>> The letter b is not in the word.
>>
>> Type a command:
>> c
>> The letter c was found in the word!
>>
>> Type a command:
>> quit
>> Thank you for playing!
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-6.4: Printing out the menu
>>
>> If the user types an empty string of characters, meaning a string that has zero length, you need to call the method `printMenu`. Note that the method `printMenu` is not in the Hangman game but in your own program.
>>
>> **Note**: checking if the string is empty is done as follows:
>>
>>```java
>> String winnie = "the pooh";
>> if(winnie.isEmpty()) {
>>     System.out.println("String was empty");
>> } else {
>>     System.out.println("I found something!");
>> }
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise 2-21.5: Printing the man and the word
>>
>> If the user has not typed the command quit, you should call the Hangman game commands `hangman.printMan()` and `hangman.printWord()`` at the end of the loop.
>>
>>```output
>> ...
>> Type a command:
>> a
>> The letter a is not in the word.
>>  ____
>>  |
>>  |
>>  |
>>  |
>> /|\
>> Word to be guessed: ????
>>
>> Type a command:
>> m
>> The letter m was found in the word!
>>  ____
>>  |
>>  |
>>  |
>>  |
>> /|\
>> Word to be guessed: m???
>>
>> Type a command:
>> quit
>> Thank you for playing!
>>```
