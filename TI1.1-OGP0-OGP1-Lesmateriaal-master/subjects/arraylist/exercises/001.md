>> ### Exercise arraylist-1: Words
>> 
>> Create a program that asks the user to input words until the user types in an empty String. Then the program prints the words the user gave. Try the for repetition sentence here. Use an ArrayList structure in your program. ArrayList is defined like this:
>>
>>```java
>> ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<String>();
>>```
>>
>>```output
>> Type a word: ~~Mozart~~
>> Type a word: ~~Schubert~~
>> Type a word: ~~Bach~~
>> Type a word: ~~Sibelius~~
>> Type a word: ~~Liszt~~
>> Type a word:
>> You typed the following words:
>> Mozart
>> Schubert
>> Bach
>> Sibelius
>> Liszt
>>```
>>
>> Note: an empty String can be detected this way:
>> 
>>```java
>> String word = reader.nextLine();
>> 
>> if ( word.isEmpty() ) {  // could also be: word.equals("")
>>    // word was empty, meaning that the user only pressed enter
>> }
>> ```
