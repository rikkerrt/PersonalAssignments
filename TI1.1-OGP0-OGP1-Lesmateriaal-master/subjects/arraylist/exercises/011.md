>> ### Exercise arraylist-11: Variance
>> 
>> Create the method `variance`, which receives a list of integers as a parameter and then returns the sample variance of that list. You can check how a sample variance is calculated in [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Population_variance_and_sample_variance), under "Population variance and sample variance".
>> 
>> **Note**: the method should use the method `average` of exercise 64 to calculate the average of the parameters. The method should be called only once!
>> 
>>```java
>> public static double variance(ArrayList<Integer> list) {
>>     // write your code here
>> }
>> 
>> public static void main(String[] args) {
>>     ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
>>     list.add(3);
>>     list.add(2);
>>     list.add(7);
>>     list.add(2);
>> 
>>     System.out.println("The variance is: " + variance(list));
>> }
>>```
>>   
>> Program output:
>> 
>>```output 
>> The variance is: 5.666667
>>```
>>     
>> (The average of the numbers is 3.5, so the sample variance is ((3 - 3.5)² + (2 - 3.5)² + (7 - 3.5)² + (2 - 3.5)²)/(4 - 1) = 5,666667.)
>> 
>> **Note while testing your program**! Sample variance for a list that contains only one item is not defined! It causes a division by zero in the formula. Java considers the result of division by zero as a *Not a Number (NaN)*.
