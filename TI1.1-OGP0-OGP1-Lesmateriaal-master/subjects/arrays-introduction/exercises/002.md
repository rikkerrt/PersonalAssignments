>>### Exercise arrays-intro-2 : Largest difference in consecutive numbers in an array
>>
>>1. Create an algorithm that takes an array and finds the largest difference between two consecutive numbers in the array. With largest difference we mean the second number minus the first number, not the absolute value of the difference (which would ignore the sign).

>>
>>      In this example the difference values are 14, 16, -8, -9 and 2, so the largest difference is 16.
>>
>>2. Test your algorithm with a series of meaningful sequences of numbers. Collect the test results in a test table.
>>      Use special cases too, such as 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 (difference is -2 each time) and -5, -1, -6, -3 (largest difference is 4).
>>
>>A good tip is to create a module to be able to quickly enter various numbers for testing.
