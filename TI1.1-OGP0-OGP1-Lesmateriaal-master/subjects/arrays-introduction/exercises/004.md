>>### Exercise arrays-intro-4 : Statistics of multiples of 3 in an array
>>
>>1. Create an algorithm in LARP that allows users to enter numbers
>>which are then stored in an array.
>>
>>2. Add an algorithm in LARP that calculates these statistics,
>>but only from those numbers in the array that are multiples of 3:
>>      - The minimum value
>>      - The maximum value
>>      - The number of values (that are a multiple of 3)
>>      - The average value (of those multiples of 3)
>>
>>3. Test your algorithm using a meaningful set of number sequences
>>and show the results in a test table.
>> For example, the table might contain:
>>
>>      |Test|Numbers|Nr 3-multiples|Min|Max|Avg|
>>      |----|-------|--------------|---|---|---|
>>      |1|1, 3, 5, 6, 3|3|3|6|4|
>>      |2|-2, 0, 9, 10|2|0|9|4.5|
>>
>>Let's assume that 0 is a multiple of 3 (it's 0 x 3) and that
>>-3 is also a multiple of 3 (its -1 x 3), but 4 is not
>>(it's 1,33333 x 3 and 1,33333 is not an integer).
