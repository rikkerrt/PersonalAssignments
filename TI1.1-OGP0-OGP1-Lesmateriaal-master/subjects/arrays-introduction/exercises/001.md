>>### Exercise arrays-intro-1 : Reverse order of entered numbers
>>
>>1. Create an algorithm that lets the user enter 5 numbers and prints them out in reverse order.
>>
>>      So if the input was 3, 6, 4, 9 then the output will be 9, 4, 6, 3.
>>
>>      Create a flowchart of the algorithm in LARP. Test the algorithm with meaningful test data and collect your results in a test table.
>>
>>      Test data are not very meaningful if they are unsuitable for revealing errors. For example, entering 1, 1, 1 as test data would not reveal that the data are printed in the original order, so this is not meaningful test data. A better choice would be 1, 2, 3, or any sequence of numbers that are distinct.
>>
>>2. Change the algorithm in such a way that the user first enters a number that determines how many numbers are to be entered.
>>
>>      Again, the algorithm should print the numbers that were entered in reverse order. Test using meaningful test data and collect the results in a test table.
>>
>>3. Optional improvement: create a LARP module that handles the entry of numbers en returns an array of numbers.
