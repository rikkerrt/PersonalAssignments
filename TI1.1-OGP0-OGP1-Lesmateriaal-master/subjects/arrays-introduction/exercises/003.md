>>### Exercise arrays-intro-3 : Calculate the root of a number
>>
>>1. Develop an algorithm in LARP for the following problem:
>>      - The user enters a number x, where x >= 1
>>      - The algoritmn calculates and outputs an approximation
>>of the square root s = &radic;x (i.e. s&sup2; = x) to within an
>>error &epsilon; of the real square root of x.
>>
>>      Use the principle of binary search to find the value of s,
>>in the following way:
>>      - We know that x >= 1 and therefore that s >= 1
>>      - We also know that s <= x, so we look for the value of s
>>between 1 and x
>>
>>      Start with a value somewhere between 1 and x and then enter a loop
>>to find a sufficiently accurate approximation:
>>
>>      In the loop, check your current approximation of s iteratively
>>(i.e. once per iteration through the loop)
>>until &verbar; s&sup2; - x &verbar; is smaller than &epsilon;, where &epsilon;
>>could for example be 10^-6.
>>      - If s&sup2; = x (or more accurately if &verbar; s&sup2; - x &verbar; < &epsilon;)
>>        then s is the square root of x and we're done
>>      - If s&sup2; < x then s is too small and we need to choose a larger s,
>>        for example a value halfway between the current s and x
>>      - If s&sup2; > x then s is too large and we need to choose a smaller s,
>>        for example a value halfway between 1 and the current s
>>
>>2. Do the same for the cube root &#8731; of x.
>>The changes to your algorithm can be minimal because the principle
>>is exactly the same.
>>
>>3. Do the same for the seventh root of x. Again, the changes are minimal.
