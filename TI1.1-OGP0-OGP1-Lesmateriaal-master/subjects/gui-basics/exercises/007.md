>>
>> **Notice:** You get the best button layout by changing the font and fontsize. In the screenshot, the font used by the buttons is set as follows:
>>
>>```java
>>Button button = new Button(" ");
>>button.setFont(Font.font("Monospaced", 40));
>>```
>>
>>#### Exercise gui-basics-7.1. User Interface
>>
>>Edit source of the application to start the graphical user interface. Use the `BorderPane` component first to set up the user interface components. Place `BorderPane` at the top of a text component that contains information in turn and the end of the game about the end of the game. Place a `GridPane` in the center of `BorderPane`, which contains 9 buttons. `GridPane` must have 3 rows and 3 columns, making a 3x3 button grid.
>>
>>#### Exercise gui-basics-7.2. Changing routes and fair play
>>
>>The game is played by X and O. The game always starts with X. Adds to the game the function where the button is pressed to update the situation by inserting the character of the player in turn (if X is the turn, X will be in the button). The turn then moves to the next player.
>>
>>The text field at the top of the game must always tell the player in turn. The text is initially "Turn X". When X plays its turn, i.e. presses a button, the text is set to "Turn: O". After O plays its turn, the text "Turn X" is set again.
>>
>>**Notice:** If a player has already played a particular screen, no other player can play it anymore. Make sure the turn does not change when a player tries to play the already played screen.
>>
>>**Note 2!** The error that you may encounter is "Local variables referenced from a lambda expression must be final or effectively final" because interfaces made from interfaces can not use variables defined outside the method. You can "circumvent" an error by creating new variables that you set up problematic values ​​just before they were introduced in the method.
>>
>>#### Exercise gui-basics-7.3: Completing the game
>>
>>Add game functionality to where the game can be played. The game ends if one of the players gets three of the same characters in the line (vertical, horizontal, oblique). The end of the game should be displayed with the text "End!" On the top. After this, the game will no longer be able to continue.
