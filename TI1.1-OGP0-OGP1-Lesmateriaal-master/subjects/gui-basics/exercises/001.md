>>### Exercise gui-basics-1 My Application
>>
>>Implement a graphical user interface with the title *"My Application"*. The application should start when the main method is executed.
>>
>>**ATTENTION:** Both here and in the upcoming task tests run the application. Existing tests have identified [problems](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX/issues/245) with Windows operating systems when the operating system scales the screen (occurs at large resolutions). Even if the tests do not work correctly locally, you can return the task to TMC, which provides feedback for the tests.
