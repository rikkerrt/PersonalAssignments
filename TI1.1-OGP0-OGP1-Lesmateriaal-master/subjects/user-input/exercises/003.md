>>![circumference](images/3_circumference.png?right)
>>
>>The [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference) of a circle is calculated using the formula $$2 \times \pi \times radius$$. Create a program that asks the user for the radius and then calculates the circumference using the given radius. Java already contains the value of pi in the `Math.PI` variable, which you can use in your calculation.
>>
>>```output
>>Type the radius: ~~20~~
>>
>>Circumference of the circle: 125.66370614359172
>>```
