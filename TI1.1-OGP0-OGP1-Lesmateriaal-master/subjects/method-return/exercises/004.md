>> ### Exercise method-return-4: Average of given numbers
>> 
>> Create the method `average`, which calculates the average of the numbers it gets as parameters. Inside the method you should use the method `sum` as a helper!
>> 
>> Place the method in the following program body:
>> 
>>```java
>> public static double average(int number1, int number2, int number3, int number4) {
>>     // write your code here
>> }
>> 
>> public static void main(String[] args) {
>>     double answer = average(4, 3, 6, 1);
>>     System.out.println("average: " + answer);
>> }
>>```
>>     
>> Program output:
>>
>>```output 
>> average: 3.5
>>```
>>     
>> Make sure you remember how you can transform a whole number (int) into a decimal number (double)!
