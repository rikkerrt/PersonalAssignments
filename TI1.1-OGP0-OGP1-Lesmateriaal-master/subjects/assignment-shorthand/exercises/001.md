>>### Exercise assignment-shorthand-1: The sum of a set of numbers
>>
>>Create a program that calculates the sum 1+2+3+â€¦+n where n is a number entered by the user.
>>
>>Example outputs:
>>
>>```output
>>Until what? ~~3~~
>>Sum is 6
>>```
>>
>>The calculation above was: 1+2+3 = 6.
>>
>>```output
>>Until what? ~~7~~
>>Sum is 28
>>```
>>
>>The calculation above was: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28.
>>
>>**Hint**: Create the program using the while statement. Use a helper variable in your program to remember how many times the block has been executed. Use also another helper variable to store the sum. During each execution add the value of the helper variable that counts the executions to the variable in which you should collect the sum.
