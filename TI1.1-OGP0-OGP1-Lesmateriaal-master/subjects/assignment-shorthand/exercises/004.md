>>### Exercise assignment-shorthand-4: Sum of the powers
>>
>>Create a program that calculates the sum of $$2^0+2^1+2^2+...+2^n$$, where n is a number entered by the user. The notation 2i means raising the number 2 to the power of i, for example $$2^4 = 2*2*2*2 = 16$$. In Java we cannot write $$a^b$$ directly, but instead we can calculate the power with the command `Math.pow(number, power)`. Note that the command returns a number of double type (i.e. floating point number). A double can be converted into the int type (i.e. whole number) as follows: `int result = (int)Math.pow(2, 3)`. This assigns the value of $$2^3$$ to variable result.
