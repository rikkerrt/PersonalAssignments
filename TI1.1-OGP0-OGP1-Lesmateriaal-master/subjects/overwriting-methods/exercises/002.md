>> ### Exercise overwriting-methods-2: Vectors
>>
>> In math, there are vectors in 2D and 3D space. Both of these vectors can calculate a length of the vector. For 2D vectors, this is calculated as $$\sqrt{x²+y²}$$, but in 3D, this is calculated as $$\sqrt{x²+y²+z²}$$ 
>>
>> #### overwriting-methods-2.1 2D Vector class
>> 
>> Build a `Vector2D` class, with attributes `double x` and `double y`, a constructor, and a method `double getLength()` that calculates the length of this vector and returns it
>>
>> ```java
>> public static void main(String[] args) {
>>     Vector2D v1 = new Vector2D(10, 10);
>>     System.out.println("Length: " + v1.getLength());
>> }
>> ```
>> 
>> ```output
>> Length: 14.142135623
>> ```
>>
>> #### overwriting-methods-2.2 3D Vector class
>>
>> Build a `Vector3D` class that extends `Vector2D`, with the attribute `double z`, and override the method `double getLength()`. 
>>
>> ```java
>> public static void main(String[] args) {
>>     Vector3D v2 = new Vector3D(10, 10, 10);
>>     System.out.println("Length: " + v2.getLength());
>> }
>> ```
>> 
>> ```output
>> Length: 17.32050808
>> ```
