>> ### Exercise overwriting-methods-1: People improved
>>
>> Now that we've seen overwriting methods, we can apply this to exercise 10-1, and overwrite a print method
>>
>> #### overwriting-methods-1.1 Person class
>> 
>> Write a class `Person` with the attributes `String name` and `int age`. Also add the constructor `public Person(String name, int age)`. You can copy the code from exercise 10-1
>> 
>> #### overwriting-methods-1.2 Printing a person
>>
>> Add a method `print` to the `Person` class that prints the name and age of this person
>>
>> ```java
>> public static void main(String[] args) {
>>    Person person = new Person("John Doe", 35);
>>    person.print();
>> }
>> ```
>>
>> ```output
>> Name: John Doe
>> Age: 35
>> ```
>> 
>> #### overwriting-methods-1.3 Extending the Person to a student
>> 
>> Make a new class `Student`, that extends the `Person` class and adds an attribute `int studentNumber`. Also add the constructor `public Student(String name, int age, int studentNumber)`. You can copy the code from exercise 10-1
>>
>> #### overwriting-methods-1.4 Adding a student printing method
>>
>> Add a method `print` to the `Student` class that prints the name, age and student number of this person
>>
>> ```java
>> public static void main(String[] args) {
>>    Person person = new Student("John Doe", 35, 1337);
>>    person.print();
>> }
>> ```
>>
>> ```output
>> Name: John Doe
>> Age: 35
>> Student number: 1337
>> ```
>>
>> **Make sure you reuse the code of the `print()` method in the `Student` class, in the `printStudent` method. do not copy/paste the code from `Person` to `Student`**
