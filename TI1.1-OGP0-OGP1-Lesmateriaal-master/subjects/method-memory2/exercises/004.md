>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-4.1: Class Student
>>
>> Implement class Student that holds the following information about a student:
>>
>> * name (`String`)
>> * studentNumber (`String`)
>>
>> The class should have the following methods:
>>
>> * A `constructor` that initializes the name and the student number with the given parameters.
>> * `public String getName()`, that returns the student name
>> * `public String getStudentNumber()`, that returns the student number
>> * `public String toString()`, that returns a String representation of the form: Pekka Mikkola (013141590)
>>
>> With the following code:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>         Student pekka = new Student("Pekka Mikkola", "013141590");
>>         System.out.println("name: " + pekka.getName());
>>         System.out.println("studentnumber: " + pekka.getStudentNumber());
>>         System.out.println(pekka);
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The output should be:
>>
>>```output
>> name: Pekka Mikkola
>> studentnumber: 013141590
>> Pekka Mikkola (013141590)
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-4.2: List of students
>>
>> Implement a main program that works as follows:
>>
>>```output
>> name: ~~Alan Turing~~
>> studentnumber: ~~017635727~~
>> name: ~~Linus Torvalds~~
>> studentnumber: ~~011288989~~
>> name: ~~Steve Jobs~~
>> studentnumber: ~~013672548~~
>> name:
>>
>> Alan Turing (017635727)
>> Linus Torvalds (011288989)
>> Steve Jobs (013672548)
>>```
>>
>> So the program asks for student information from the user until the user gives a student an empty name. After the student info has been enteres, all the students are printed. From each inputted name-studentnumber-pair, the program should create a `Student` object. The program should store the students in an `ArrayList` which is defined as follows:
>>
>>```java
>> ArrayList<Student> list = new ArrayList<Student>();
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-4.3: Search
>>
>> Extend the program of the previous part so that after the student info has been entered and students printed, the user can search the student list based on a given search term. The extended program should work in the following manner:
>>
>>```output
>> name: ~~Carl Gustaf Mannerheim~~
>> studentnumber: ~~015696234~~
>> name: ~~Steve Jobs~~
>> studentnumber: ~~013672548~~
>> name: ~~Edsger Dijkstra~~
>> studentnumber: ~~014662803~~
>> name:
>>
>> Carl Gustaf Mannerheim (015696234)
>> Steve Jobs (013672548)
>> Edsger Dijkstra (014662803)
>>
>> Give search term: ~~st~~
>> Result:
>> Carl Gustaf Mannerheim (015696234)
>> Edsger Dijkstra (014662803)
>>```
>>
>> **TIP**: in the search you should iterate (using for or for-each) through the student list and by using the method `contains` of String check if a student's name (obtained with method `getName`) matches the search term.
