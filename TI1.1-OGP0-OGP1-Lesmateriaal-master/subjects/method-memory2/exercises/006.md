>> ### Exercise method-memory2-6: Team and Players
>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-6.1: Class Team
>>
>> Implement a class `Team`. At this stage team has only a name (`String`) and the following functionality:
>>
>> * a constructor that sets the team name
>> * `public String getName()`, that returns the name
>>
>> With the code:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>     Team barcelona = new Team("FC Barcelona");
>>     System.out.println("Team: " + barcelona.getName());
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> the output should be::
>>
>>```output
>> Team: FC Barcelona
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-6.2: Player
>> 
>> Create a class `Player` with the instance variables for the player name and the amount of goals. A player should have *two constructors*: one that initializes the name and an another that initializes the name and the amount of goals. Implement also the following methods:
>>
>> * `public String getName()`, returns the player name
>> * `public int goals()`, returns the amount of goals
>> * `public String toString()`, returns a string representation that is formed as in the example below
>> Example usage:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>     Team barcelona = new Team("FC Barcelona");
>>     System.out.println("Team: " + barcelona.getName());
>>
>>         Player brian = new Player("Brian");
>>         System.out.println("Player: " + brian);
>>
>>         Player pekka = new Player("Pekka", 39);
>>         System.out.println("Player: " + pekka);
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> and the expected output:
>>
>>```output
>> Team: FC Barcelona
>> Player: Brian, goals 0
>> Player: Pekka, goals 39
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-6.3: Adding players to a team
>>
>> Add to the class `Team` the following methods:
>>
>> * `public void addPlayer`, adds a player to the team
>> * `public void printPlayers()`, prints the players in the team
>>
>> You should store the players to an instance variable of the type `ArrayList<Player>` within the class Team.
>>
>> With the code:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>     Team barcelona = new Team("FC Barcelona");
>>
>>         Player brian = new Player("Brian");
>>         Player pekka = new Player("Pekka", 39);
>>
>>         barcelona.addPlayer(brian);
>>         barcelona.addPlayer(pekka);
>>         barcelona.addPlayer(new Player("Mikael", 1)); // works similarly as the above
>>
>>         barcelona.printPlayers();
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> the output should be:
>>
>>```output
>> Brian, goals 0
>> Pekka, goals 39
>> Mikael, goals 1
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-6.4: The team maximum size and current size
>>
>> Add to the class Team the methods
>>
>> * `public void setMaxSize(int maxSize)`, sets the maximum number of players that the team can have
>> * `public int size()`, returns the number of players in the team
>>
>> By default the maximum number of players should be set to 16, and that can be changed with the method setMaxSize. Change the method addPlayer so that it does not add players to the team if the team already has the maximum number of players.
>>
>> With the code:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>     Team barcelona = new Team("FC Barcelona");
>>         barcelona.setMaxSize(1);
>>
>>         Player brian = new Player("Brian");
>>         Player pekka = new Player("Pekka", 39);
>>         barcelona.addPlayer(brian);
>>         barcelona.addPlayer(pekka);
>>         barcelona.addPlayer(new Player("Mikael", 1)); // works similarly as the above
>>
>>         System.out.println("Number of players: " + barcelona.size());
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>> the output should be
>>
>>```output
>> Number of players: 1
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-6.5: Goals of a team
>> Add to the class `Team` the method
>>
>> * `goals`, returns the total number of goals for all the players in the team
>>
>> With the code:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>         Team barcelona = new Team("FC Barcelona");
>>
>>         Player brian = new Player("Brian");
>>         Player pekka = new Player("Pekka", 39);
>>         barcelona.addPlayer(brian);
>>         barcelona.addPlayer(pekka);
>>         barcelona.addPlayer(new Player("Mikael", 1)); // works similarly as the above
>>
>>         System.out.println("Total goals: " + barcelona.goals());
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> the output should be
>>
>>```output
>> Total goals: 40
>>```
