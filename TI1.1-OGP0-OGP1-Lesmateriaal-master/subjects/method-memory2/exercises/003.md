>> ### Exercise method-memory2-3: Apartment comparison
>>
>> The information system of a Housing service represents the apartments it has for sale using objects of the following class:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Apartment {
>>     private int rooms;
>>     private int squareMeters;
>>     private int pricePerSquareMeter;
>>
>>     public Apartment(int rooms, int squareMeters, int pricePerSquareMeter){
>>         this.rooms = rooms;
>>         this.squareMeters = squareMeters;
>>         this.pricePerSquareMeter = pricePerSquareMeter;
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> Next you should implement a couple of methods that help in apartment comparisons.
>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-3.1: Larger
>>
>> Implement the method `public boolean larger(Apartment otherApartment)` that returns true if the Apartment object for which the method is called (`this`) is larger than the apartment object given as parameter (`otherApartment`).
>>
>> Example of the usage:
>>
>>```java
>> Apartment studioManhattan = new Apartment(1, 16, 5500);
>> Apartment twoRoomsBrooklyn = new Apartment(2, 38, 4200);
>> Apartment fourAndKitchenBronx = new Apartment(3, 78, 2500);
>>
>> System.out.println( studioManhattan.larger(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );       // false
>> System.out.println( fourAndKitchenBronx.larger(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );   // true
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-3.2: Price difference
>>
>> Implement the method `public int priceDifference(Apartment otherApartment)` that returns the absolute value of the price difference of the Apartment object for which the method is called (`this`) and the apartment object given as parameter (otherApartment). The price of an apartment is `squareMeters * pricePerSquareMeter`.
>>
>> Example of the usage:
>>
>>```java
>> Apartment studioManhattan = new Apartment(1, 16, 5500);
>> Apartment twoRoomsBrooklyn = new Apartment(2, 38, 4200);
>> Apartment fourAndKitchenBronx = new Apartment(3, 78, 2500);
>>
>> System.out.println( studioManhattan.priceDifference(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );        // 71600
>> System.out.println( fourAndKitchenBronx.priceDifference(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );    // 35400
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise method-memory2-3.3: more expensive than
>>
>> Implement the method `public boolean moreExpensiveThan(Apartment otherApartment)` that returns true if the object `Apartment` for which the method is called (this) has a higher price than the apartment object given as parameter (`otherApartment`).
>>
>> Example of the usage:
>>
>>```java
>> Apartment studioManhattan = new Apartment(1, 16, 5500);
>> Apartment twoRoomsBrooklyn = new Apartment(2, 38, 4200);
>> Apartment fourAndKitchenBronx = new Apartment(3, 78, 2500);
>>
>> System.out.println( studioManhattan.moreExpensiveThan(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );       // false
>> System.out.println( fourAndKitchenBronx.moreExpensiveThan(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );   // true
>>```
