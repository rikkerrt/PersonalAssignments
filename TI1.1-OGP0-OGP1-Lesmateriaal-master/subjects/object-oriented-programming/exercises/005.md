>> ### Exercise oop-5: Menu
>>
>> In this assignment, we will implement a class Menu that holds information about meals that are available in a cafeteria.
>>
>> Our starting point is the following class skeleton:
>>
>>```java
>> import java.util.ArrayList;
>>
>> public class Menu {
>>
>>     private ArrayList<String> meals;
>>
>>     public Menu() {
>>         this.meals = new ArrayList<String>();
>>     }
>>
>>     // Implement the methods here
>> }
>>```
>>
>> Menu objects store the information of meals using an object variable of type `ArrayList<String>`
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-5.1: Adding a meal to menu
>>
>> Implement the method public void `addMeal(String meal)` that adds a new meal to the list `this.meals` of a Menu object. If the meal is already in the list, it should not be added.
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-5.2: Printing the menu
>>
>> Implement the method public void `printMeals()` that prints the meals in a menu. As an example, the output after three additions could be:
>>
>>```output
>> Hamburger
>> Fish'n'Chips
>> Sauerkraut
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-5.3: Clearing a menu
>>
>> Implement the method public void `clearMenu()` that clears a menu. After calling this method, the menu should be empty. Class `ArrayList` has a method that is useful here. Within your method body write meals. and see how IntelliJ helps you by showing the available methods.
