>> ### Exercise oop-8: NumberStatistics
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-8.1: Amount of numbers
>>
>> Implement class `NumberStatistics` with the following methods:
>>
>> * `addNumber` adds a new number to the statistics
>> * `amountOfNumbers` tells us how many numbers have been added to the statistics
>> Note that the class *should not store* the added numbers. At this stage, it is enough to remember how many added numbers there are, i.e. how many times the method addNumber has been called.
>>
>> The class skeleton:
>>
>>```java
>> public class NumberStatistics {
>>     private int amountOfNumbers;
>>
>>     public NumberStatistics() {
>>         // initialize here the object variable amountOfNumbers
>>     }
>>
>>     public void addNumber(int number) {
>>         // code here
>>     }
>>
>>     public int amountOfNumbers() {
>>         // code here
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> A usage example:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>    public static void main(String[] args) {
>>       NumberStatistics stats = new NumberStatistics();
>>       stats.addNumber(3);
>>       stats.addNumber(5);
>>       stats.addNumber(1);
>>       stats.addNumber(2);
>>       System.out.println("Amount: " + stats.amountOfNumbers());
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The output should be:
>>
>>```output
>> Amount: 4
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-8.2: sum and average
>>
>> Add the following methods to the class:
>>
>> * `sum` returns the sum of the added numbers (if no numbers added, the sum is 0)
>> * `average` returns the average of the added numbers (if no numbers added, the average is 0)
>>
>> The class skeleton now:
>>
>>```java
>> public class NumberStatistics {
>>     private int amountOfNumbers;
>>     private int sum;
>>
>>     public NumberStatistics() {
>>         // initialize here the object variable amountOfNumbers
>>     }
>>
>>     public void addNumber(int number) {
>>         // code here
>>     }
>>
>>     public int amountOfNumbers() {
>>         // code here
>>     }
>>
>>     public int sum() {
>>         // code here
>>     }
>>
>>     public double average() {
>>         // code here
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> A usage example:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>         NumberStatistics stats = new NumberStatistics();
>>         stats.addNumber(3);
>>         stats.addNumber(5);
>>         stats.addNumber(1);
>>         stats.addNumber(2);
>>         System.out.println("Amount: " + stats.amountOfNumbers());
>>         System.out.println("sum: " + stats.sum());
>>         System.out.println("average: " + stats.average());
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The output should be:
>>
>>```output
>> Amount: 4
>> sum: 11
>> average: 2.75
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-8.3: Asking for numbers from the user
>>
>> Create a program that asks the user to input numbers of type integer. When the user gives -1, the program stops and prints the sum of the given numbers (excluding the -1).
>>
>> **Note**: you should not make any changes to class NumberStatistics!
>>
>> The program should use a `NumberStatistics` object to calculate the sum.
>>
>>```output
>> Type numbers:
>> ~~4~~
>> ~~2~~
>> ~~5~~
>> ~~4~~
>> ~~-1~~
>> sum: 15
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-8.4: Many sums
>>
>> Change your program so that it also calculates the sum of even and odd numbers in the user input (again -1 excluded).
>>
>> **NOTE**: define in your program three `NumberStatistics` objects. The first is used to track the sum of all the numbers. The second takes care of even numbers and the third the odd numbers. Remember also that you should not make any changes to class NumberStatistics!
>>
>> **The tests does not work if you do not create the objects in the order mentioned above!!**
>>
>> The program should work as follows:
>>
>>```output
>> Type numbers:
>> ~~4~~
>> ~~2~~
>> ~~5~~
>> ~~2~~
>> -1~~
>> sum: 13
>> sum of even: 8
>> sum of odd: 5
>>```
