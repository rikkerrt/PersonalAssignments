>> ### Exercise oop-6: Lyyra-card
>>
>> The University of Helsinki students use a so-called Lyyra cards to pay for their meals in student cafeterias. In this assignment, we implement the class LyyraCard that simulates the Lyyra card.
>>
>> #### oop-6.1: Class skeleton
>>
>> Start by adding the class `LyyraCard` to your project.
>>
>> Then implement the `LyyraCard` constructor that gets the starting balance of the card as parameter. The card saves the balance in the object variable `balance`. Implement also the `toString` method that returns a string of the form "The card has X euros".
>>
>> The skeleton of class `LyyraCard` looks like this:
>>
>>```java
>> public class LyyraCard {
>>     private double balance;
>>
>>     public LyyraCard(double balanceAtStart) {
>>         // write code here
>>     }
>>
>>     public String toString() {
>>         // write code here
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The following main program can be used to test the program:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>         LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(50);
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The output should be:
>>
>>```output
>> The card has 50.0 euros
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-6.2: Paying with card
>>
>> Implement the following methods to `LyyraCard`:
>>
>>```java
>> public void payEconomical() {
>>     // write code here
>> }
>>
>> public void payGourmet() {
>>     // write code here
>> }
>>```
>>
>> Method `payEconomical` should decrease the balance by 2.50 euros and method `payGourmet` by 4.00 euros.
>>
>> The following main program can be used to test the program:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>         LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(50);
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>
>>         card.payEconomical();
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>
>>         card.payGourmet();
>>         card.payEconomical();
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The output should be:
>>
>>```output
>> The card has 50.0 euros
>> The card has 47.5 euros
>> The card has 41.0 euros
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-6.3: Balance nonnegative
>>
>> Change methods `payEconomical` and `payGourmet` so that if there is not enought money, the balance does not change.
>>
>> The following main program can be used to test the program:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>         LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(5);
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>
>>         card.payGourmet();
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>
>>         card.payGourmet();
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The output should be:
>>
>>```output
>> The card has 5.0 euros
>> The card has 1.0 euros
>> The card has 1.0 euros
>>```
>>
>> Above, the second call `payGourmet` does not alter the balance since there is not enough money on the card for a gourmet lunch.
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-6.4: Loading money to card
>>
>> Add the `LyyraCard` the following method:
>>
>>```java
>> public void loadMoney(double amount) {
>>     // write code here
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The method should increase the balance of the card by the given amount. However, the maximum balance on a card is 150 euros. In case the balance after loading money would be more than that, it should be truncated to 150 euros.
>>
>> The following main program can be used to test the program:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>         LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(10);
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>
>>         card.loadMoney(15);
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>
>>         card.loadMoney(10);
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>
>>         card.loadMoney(200);
>>         System.out.println(card);
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The output should be:
>>
>>```output
>> The card has 10.0 euros
>> The card has 25.0 euros
>> The card has 35.0 euros
>> The card has 150.0 euros
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-6.5: Loading a negative amount
>>
>> Change the method `loadMoney` so that the balance of the card does not change if the amount to load is negative.
>>
>> The following main program can be used to test the program:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>         LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(10);
>>         System.out.println("Pekka: " + card);
>>         card.loadMoney(-15);
>>         System.out.println("Pekka: " + card);
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The output should be:
>>
>>```output
>> Pekka: The card has 10.0 euros
>> Pekka: The card has 10.0 euros
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise oop-6.6: Multiple cards
>>
>> Write a main method that does the following:
>>
>> * Creates a LyyraCard for Pekka with initial balance of 20 euros
>> * Creates a LyyraCard for Brian with initial balance of 30 euros
>> * Pekka buys gourmet lunch
>> * Brian buys economical lunch
>> * cards are printed (both on their own row, starting with the name of the card owner)
>> * Pekka loads 20 euros
>> * Brian buys gourmet lunch
>> * cards are printed (both on their own row, starting with the name of the card owner)
>> * Pekka buys economical lunch
>> * Pekka buys economical lunch
>> * Brian loads 50 euros
>> * cards are printed (both on their own row, starting with the name of the card owner)
>> * The main skeleton is as follows:
>>
>>```java
>> public class Main {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>         LyyraCard cardPekka = new LyyraCard(20);
>>         LyyraCard cardBrian = new LyyraCard(30);
>>
>>         // write code here
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The output should be:
>>
>>```output
>> Pekka: The card has 16.0 euros
>> Brian: The card has 27.5 euros
>> Pekka: The card has 36.0 euros
>> Brian: The card has 23.5 euros
>> Pekka: The card has 31.0 euros
>> Brian: The card has 73.5 euros
>>```
