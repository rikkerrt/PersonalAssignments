>>### Exercise flowchart-1 : Raising prices
>>
>>1. Design a flowchart for raising the price of an item in a shop according to the following rules:
>>
>>      - Items more expensive than €25 are raised in price by €1
>>      - Items cheaper than €10 are raised in price by €0.25
>>      - All other items are raised in price by 3%
>>
>>2. Construct the flowchart in LARP.
>>
>>3. Think about which prices you would like to use to test the output of this algorithm. Obviously you will want to check each of the three possible ways of raising the price.
>>
>>4. Test your algorithm with the prices that you came up with in the previous step. Record your results in a test table:
>>
>>      |Price (€)|Raised price (€)|Output of your algorithm (€)|OK or not OK?|
>>      |---------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------|
>>      | 25      | 25.75          | 26 *(for example)*         | Not OK      |
>>      | *add your own* |  |  |  |
>>      |  |  |  |  |
>>
>>5. Compare your results with those of other students and discuss those results. Did you check all three possible paths through your flowchart? Would you be able to detect an error in the flowchart with your tests? Try it: change 0.25 to 0.75 and re-run your tests.
