>>### Exercise flowchart-2 : Point inside, on edge of or outside a circle
>>
>>1. Design a flowchart for an algorithm that determines whether a point P is within a circle, on the edge of the circle, or outside the circle. The edge of the circle is not infinitely thin but has a certain thickness. The point P has coordinates (xp, yp) and no dimension.
>>
>>2. Think about which specific circles and points you should test this algorithm. Pay special attention to unusual input values, such as a negative radius of the circle or an edge thickness that is negative. Make a sketch on paper of the circles and the points that you're going to use for testing, to help visualize those test cases for yourself.
>>
>>3. Make a table with all input values that you want to use for testing. There are obviously three cases that you must at least test:
>>      1. Point is inside the circle
>>      2. Point is on the edge of the circle
>>      3. Point is outside the circle
>>
>>4. Construct the flowchart of your algorithm in LARP and test it with the chosen values from the previous steps. Enter your results in the table.<br>
>>Does your algorithm provide the correct output in all test cases? Does it crash when you enter unusual (or plainly wrong) values?
>>
>>5. Compare your results with those of other students and discuss those results. Use your own test values on their algorithm and vice versa to check that their algorithm works correctly and that it doesn't crash.
