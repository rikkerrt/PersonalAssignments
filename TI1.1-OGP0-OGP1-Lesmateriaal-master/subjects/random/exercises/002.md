>> ### Exercise random-2: Password randomizer
>>
>> Your assignment is to expand the class `PasswordRandomizer` that has the following functionality:
>>
>> The constructor PasswordRandomizer creates a new object, which uses the given password length.
>> The method createPassword returns a new password, which consists of symbols a-z and is of the length given as a parameter to the constructor
>> The frame of the class is as follows:
>>
>>```java
>> import java.util.Random;
>>
>> public class PasswordRandomizer {
>>     // Define the variables here
>>
>>     public PasswordRandomizer(int length) {
>>         // Format the variable here
>>     }
>>
>>     public String createPassword() {
>>       // Write the code here which returns the new password
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> In the following is a program that uses a PasswordRandomizer object:
>>
>>```java
>> public
>> class Program {
>>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>>         PasswordRandomizer randomizer = new PasswordRandomizer(13);
>>         System.out.println("Password: " + randomizer.createPassword());
>>         System.out.println("Password: " + randomizer.createPassword());
>>         System.out.println("Password: " + randomizer.createPassword());
>>         System.out.println("Password: " + randomizer.createPassword());
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>> The output could look something like this:
>>
>>```output
>> Password: mcllsoompezvs
>> Password: urcxboisknkme
>> Password: dzaccatonjcqu
>> Password: bpqmedlbqaopq
>>```
>>
>> **Tip 1**: this is how you turn the integer number into a character:
>>
>>```java
>> int number = 17;
>> char symbol = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".charAt(number);
>>```
>>
>> **Tip 2**: The tip in assignment 58 might be useful in this one too.
