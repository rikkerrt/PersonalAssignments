>> ### Exercise exceptions-2: Sensors and Temperature Measurement
>>
>> All the code in our application has to be placed into the package `application`.
>>
>>We have got the following interface available for our use:
>>
>>```java
>>public interface Sensor {
>>    boolean isOn();  // returns true if the sensor is on
>>    void on();       // switches the sensor on
>>    void off();      // switches the sensor off
>>    int measure();   // returns the sensor reading if the sensor is on
>>                     // if the sensor is off, it throws an IllegalStateException
>>}
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise exceptions-2.1: Constant Sensor
>>
>>Create the class `ConstantSensor` which implements the interface `Sensor`.
>>
>>The constant sensor is online all the time. The methods  `on()` and `off()` do not do anything. The `ConstantSensor` has a constructor with an `int` parameter. The method `measure` returns the number received as constructor parameter.
>>
>>For instance:
>>
>>```java
>>public static void main(String[] args) {
>>   ConstantSensor ten = new ConstantSensor(10);
>>   ConstantSensor minusFive = new ConstantSensor(-5);
>>
>>   System.out.println( ten.measure() );
>>   System.out.println( minusFive.measure() );
>>
>>   System.out.println( ten.isOn() );
>>   ten.off();
>>   System.out.println( ten.isOn() );
>>}
>>```
>>
>>Prints
>>
>>```output
>>10
>>-5
>>true
>>true
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise exceptions-2.2: Thermometer
>>
>>Create the class `Thermometer` which implements the interface `Sensor`.
>>
>>At first, the thermometer is off. When the method `measure` is called, if the thermometer is on it returns a random number between -30 and 30. If the thermometer is off, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.
>>
>> #### Exercise exceptions-2.3: AverageSensor
>>
>> Create the class `AverageSensor` which implements the interface `Sensor`.
>>
>>An average sensor contains many sensors. In addition to the methods defined by the interface `Sensor`, the class has the method `public void addSensor(Sensor additional)` which adds a new sensor to the `AverageSensor`.
>>
>>The average sensor is on when *all* its sensors are on. When the average sensor is switched on, all its sensors have to be switched on if they were not on already. When the average sensor is closed, at least one of its sensors has to be switched off. It's also possible that all its sensors are switched off.
>>
>>The method `measure` of our `AverageSensor` returns the average of the readings of all its sensors (because the return value is int, the readings are rounded down as it is for integer division). If the method `measure` is called when the average sensor is off, or if the average sensor was not added any sensor, the method throws an `IllegalStateException`.
>>
>> Below, you find an example of a sensor program (note that both the `Thermometer` and the `AverageSensor` constructors are without parameter):
>>
>>```java
>>public static void main(String[] args) {
>>    Sensor breda = new Thermometer();
>>    breda.on();
>>    System.out.println("the temperature in Breda is "+breda.measure() + " degrees");
>>
>>    Sensor eindhoven = new Thermometer();
>>    Sensor tilburg = new Thermometer();
>>
>>    AverageSensor brabantArea = new AverageSensor();
>>    brabantArea.addSensor(breda);
>>    brabantArea.addSensor(tilburg);
>>    brabantArea.addSensor(eindhoven);
>>
>>    brabantArea.on();
>>    System.out.println("the temperature in Brabant area is "+brabantArea.measure() + " degrees");
>>}
>>```
>>
>>Prints (the printed readings depend on the random temperature readings):
>>
>>```output
>>the temperature in Breda is -7 degrees
>>the temperature in Brabant area is -10 degrees
>>```
>>
>>**Note:** you'd better use a `ConstantSensor` object to test your average sensor!
>>
>> #### Exercise exceptions-2.4: All Readings
>>
>>Add the method `public List<Integer> readings()` to the class `AverageSensor`; it returns a list of the reading results of all the measurements executed through `AverageSensor`. Below is an example of how the method works:
>>
>>```java
>>public static void main(String[] args) {
>>    Sensor breda = new Thermometer();
>>    Sensor tilburg = new Thermometer();
>>    Sensor eindhoven = new Thermometer();
>>
>>    AverageSensor brabantArea = new AverageSensor();
>>    brabantArea.addSensor(breda);
>>    brabantArea.addSensor(tilburg);
>>    brabantArea.addSensor(eindhoven);
>>
>>    brabantArea.on();
>>    System.out.println("the temperature in Brabant area is "+brabantArea.measure() + " degrees");
>>    System.out.println("the temperature in Brabant area is "+brabantArea.measure() + " degrees");
>>    System.out.println("the temperature in Brabant area is "+brabantArea.measure() + " degrees");
>>
>>    System.out.println("readings: "+brabantArea.readings());
>>}
>>```
>>
>>Prints (again, the printed readings depend on the random temperature readings):
>>
>>```output
>>the temperature in Brabant area is -10 degrees
>>the temperature in Brabant area is -4 degrees
>>the temperature in Brabant area is -5 degrees
>>
>>readings: [-10, -4, 5]
>>```
