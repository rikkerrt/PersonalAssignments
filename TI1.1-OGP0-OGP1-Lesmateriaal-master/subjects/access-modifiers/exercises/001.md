>> ### Exercise access-modifiers-1: Abstract macro
>>
>> To automate tasks on your computer, java has a `Robot` class. This class is provided by java, and has the following features
>>
>> ```java
>> Robot r = new Robot();
>> r.mouseMove(100, 100);                   // moves the mouse to 100, 100
>> r.mousePress(InputEvent.BUTTON1_MASK);   // presses down the left mouse
>> r.delay(50);                             // waits for 50ms
>> r.mouseRelease(InputEvent.BUTTON1_MASK); // releases the mouse again
>> ```
>>
>> We're going to build a `Macro` class, that can combine any number of actions into a list, and then execute them in order, with a small delay inbetween. The delay is set to a default of 250ms, but can be changed by any specific macro object. We're going to build code that allows us to 
>>
>> - Move the mouse to a position
>> - Click on a position
>> - Wait for a delay
>>
>> The code to test this macro class would be
>>
>> ```java
>> import java.awt.*;
>> import java.awt.event.*;
>>
>> Macro macro = new Macro();
>> macro.add(new MouseMove(100, 100));
>> macro.add(new MouseClick());
>> macro.add(new Wait(100));
>> macro.add(new MouseClick());
>> macro.run();
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise access-modifiers-1.1
>>
>> We're going to start by building an abstract class `Action`. **Put this action in the `actions` package**. The `Action` class has
>>
>> - an integer attribute `delay`, that gets set to 250 in the constructor
>> - a setter for the `delay`
>> - a **protected** abstract method `void perform()`
>> - a public method `performAndWait()`, that executes the `perform()` method, and then waits for the time set in the `delay` attribute
>>
>> #### Exercise access-modifiers-1.2
>>
>> Build the classes `MouseMove`, `MouseClick` and `Wait`. These classes all extend the Action class, and are all located in the `actions` package. In the classes, implement the `perform()` method, and put the proper code there to either move the mouse, click the mouse or to wait. Don't forget to import the `Robot` class from the `java.awt` package, and the `InputEvent` from the `java.awt.event` package
>>
>> #### Exercise access-modifiers-1.3
>>
>> Build a `Macro` class, in the **default package** and test it with the `main` method. The class should have the following:
>>
>> - an attribute `ArrayList<Action> actions`;
>> - a method `add(Action action)`, that adds the action to the actions arraylist
>> - a `run` method, that loops through the `actions` ArrayList, and runs the `performAndWait()` method.
