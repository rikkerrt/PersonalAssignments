>> ### Exercise abstract-classes-2: Walking monsters
>>
>> Given is a simulation with a `Hero` and `Enemy`s. All these `Character`s are simulated, and can walk around, and attack other characters. 
>> 
>> ![classdiagram](images/ex5.png)
>>
>> In this diagram we can see see it is quite easy to add new enemies, just extend the `Enemy` class. The `Character` class provides the following methods:
>>
>> - `getX()` and `getY()` to get the position of the character
>> - `moveTo(int x, int y)` to move the character to another position
>> - `distanceTo(int x, int y)` and `distanceTo(Character other)` to calculate the distance to another character
>> - `ArrayList<Character> getCharactersNear(int range, boolean isEnemy)` returns a list of all the enemies around this character
>> - `spawn(Character character)` adds a new character
>> - `suicide()` kills this character
>>
>> Provided is a simple enemy, the `RandomEnemy`, that just moves around randomly.
>>
>> #### Exercise abstract-classes-2.1 : Running away
>>
>> Create a new enemy called `RunningEnemy` that will run away from the hero characters near. Create the class, and override the `update()` method to run away from any players nearby. Give this enemy a 'R' as display character, and a health of 1
>>
>> #### Exercise abstract-classes-2.2 : Breeding enemies
>>
>> Create a new enemy, called `BreedingEnemy`. The behavious of this enemy should be
>>
>> - If a player is nearby, it should go towards the player to attack it 
>> - If no player is nearby, it should move towards other `BreedingEnemy` nearby.
>> - If the enemy is next to another `BreedingEnemy`, it should perform suicide on both BreedingEnemies, and make 1 new BreedingEnemy (and spawn it), with the health of both enemies, multiplied by 2
>>
>> **Note** Due to time constraints, this exercise does not test the behavious completely
