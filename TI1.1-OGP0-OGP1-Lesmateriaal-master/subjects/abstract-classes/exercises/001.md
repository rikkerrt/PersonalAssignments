>> ### Exercise abstract-classes-1: Bank accounts
>>
>> A bank has 2 kinds of accounts, a deposit account and a savings account. Deposit account costs 5 euro per year, and has no interest. A savings account costs 50 euro per year but has 5% interest.
>> We are going to model this using an abstract class
>>
>> #### abstract-classes-1.1 Account class
>>
>> An account stores the name of the type of the account (Savings or Deposit), and have an amount of money on them. We will model these as attributes. Make an abstract class `Account` with the following properties
>>
>> - attribute `String name`
>> - attribute `double amount`
>> - Constructor with parameters `String name` and `double initialAmount`. The name attribute gets set to `name + " (initial " + amount + ")"`
>> - getter and setter for `amount`. Make sure the setter rounds the amount to 2 decimals
>> - toString that prints `name - amount`
>> - abstract `void calculateNextYear()`
>> 
>> #### abstract-classes-1.2 Savings and Deposit account
>>
>> Make a class `DepositAccount` that extends `Account`. Implement a constructor with 1 parameter, `initialAmount`. The name is set to 'Deposit'. The class `DepositAccount` overwrites the calculateNextYear, which **sets** the amount to the amount - 5.
>>
>> Make a class `SavingsAccount` that extends `Account`. Implement a constructor with 1 parameter, `initialAmount`. The name is set to 'Savings'. The class `SavingsAccount` overwrites the calculateNextYear, which **sets** the amount to the (amount - 50) * 1.05.
>>
>> #### abstract-classes-1-3 Using the accounts
>>
>> Write a main method that tests the accounts. Make a program that outputs the following output (use the toString for the account to print the accounts)
>>
>> ```output
>> Year 1
>> Savings (initial 500.0) - 472.5
>> Savings (initial 1500.0) - 1522.5
>> Deposit (initial 500.0) - 495.0
>> Deposit (initial 1500.0) - 1495.0
>> 
>> Year 2
>> Savings (initial 500.0) - 443.63
>> Savings (initial 1500.0) - 1546.13
>> Deposit (initial 500.0) - 490.0
>> Deposit (initial 1500.0) - 1490.0
>> 
>> Year 3
>> Savings (initial 500.0) - 413.31
>> Savings (initial 1500.0) - 1570.94
>> Deposit (initial 500.0) - 485.0
>> Deposit (initial 1500.0) - 1485.0
>> ```
