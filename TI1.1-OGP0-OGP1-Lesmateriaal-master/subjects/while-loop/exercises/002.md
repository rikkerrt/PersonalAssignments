>>### Exercise while-loop-2 : Temperatures
>>
>>You will get the `Graph` component along with the exercise template. Graph draws graphs based on numbers that are given to it. You can give it numbers as follows:
>>
>>```java
>>Graph.addNumber(13.0);
>>```
>>
>>We will create a program that draws a graph based on daily temperatures given to it.
>>
>>#### Exercise while-loop-2.1: Asking for numbers
>>
>>Create a program that asks the user to input floating point numbers (double) and then adds the numbers to the graph. Use the while-true structure again.
>>
>>Note: To read a `double`, use: `double number = Double.parseDouble(reader.nextLine());`
>>
>>#### Exercise while-loop-2.2: Checking
>>
>>Improve your program so that temperatures below -30 degrees or over +40 degrees are ignored and not added to the graph.
