>>### Exercise while-loop-8: Up to a certain number
>>
>>Create a program that prints all whole numbers from 1 to the number the user enters
>>
>>```output
>>Up to what number? ~~3~~
>>1
>>2
>>3
>>```
>>
>>```output
>>Up to what number? ~~5~~
>>1
>>2
>>3
>>4
>>5
>>```
>>
>>*Tip*: The number you read from the user now works as the upper limit in the condition of the `while` statement. Remember that in Java `a <= b` means a is *less than or equal to b*.
