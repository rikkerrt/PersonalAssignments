>>### Exercise while-loop-3 : NHL statistics, part 2
>>
>>We will continue using the NHL component introduced earlier and create a program that the user can use to query for statistics.
>>
>>The program is structured similarly to the Calculator example program above. The program body is as follows:
>>
>>```java
>>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
>>    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
>>
>>    System.out.println("NHL statistics service");
>>    boolean running = true;
>>    while (running) {
>>        System.out.println("");
>>        System.out.print("command (points, goals, assists, penalties, player, club, quit): ");
>>        String command = reader.nextLine();
>>
>>        if (command.equals("quit")) {
>>            running = false;
>>        } else if (command.equals("points")) {
>>            // print the top ten playes sorted by points
>>        } else if (command.equals("goals")) {
>>            // print the top ten players sorted by goals
>>        } else if (command.equals("assists")) {
>>            // print the top ten players sorted by assists
>>        } else if (command.equals("penalties")) {
>>            // print the top ten players sorted by penalties
>>        } else if (command.equals("player")) {
>>            // ask the user for the player name and print the statistics for that player
>>        } else if (command.equals("club")) {
>>            // ask the user for the club abbreviation and print the statistics for the club
>>            // note: the statistics should be sorted by points
>>            //     (players with the most points are first)
>>        }
>>    }
>>}
>>```
>>
>>The program asks the user to give commands and then executes the operation that is associated with the given command. The commands are: *points, goals, assists, penalties, player, club, quit*.
>>
>>You should write code in the parts marked with comments.
>>
>>Here is an example demonstrating the program in action:
>>```output
>>NHL statistics service
>>
>>command (points, goals, assists, penalties, player, club): ~~assists~~
>>Henrik Sedin           VAN        43 11 + 38= 49  36
>>Erik Karlsson          OTT        43  6 + 35= 41  24
>>Claude Giroux          PHI        36 18 + 30= 48  16
>>Pavel Datsyuk          DET        41 13 + 30= 43  10
>>Brian Campbell         FLA        42  3 + 30= 33   4
>>Daniel Sedin           VAN        42 18 + 29= 47  32
>>Jason Pominville       BUF        41 14 + 29= 43   8
>>Nicklas Backstrom      WSH        38 13 + 29= 42  22
>>Joffrey Lupul          TOR        41 19 + 28= 47  36
>>Evgeni Malkin          PIT        33 16 + 28= 44  30
>>
>>command (points, goals, assists, penalties, player, club): ~~player~~
>>which player: Jokinen
>>Olli Jokinen           CGY        43 12 + 21= 33  32
>>Jussi Jokinen          CAR        40  4 + 19= 23  30
>>
>>command (points, goals, assists, penalties, player, club): ~~club~~
>>which club: DET
>>Pavel Datsyuk          DET        41 13 + 30= 43  10
>>Johan Franzen          DET        41 16 + 20= 36  34
>>Valtteri Filppula      DET        40 14 + 21= 35  10
>>Henrik Zetterberg      DET        41  8 + 24= 32  14
>>// and more players
>>
>>command (points, goals, assists, penalties, player, club): ~~quit~~
>>```
>>
>>**Note:** When you first run the program, the execution might take a while because the information is downloaded from the internet. Execution should be quick after the first run.
