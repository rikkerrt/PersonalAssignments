>>### Exercise while-loop-1 : Password
>>
>>In this exercise we create a program that asks the user for a password. If the password is right, a secret message is shown to the user.
>>
>>```output
>>Type the password: ~~turnip~~
>>Wrong!
>>Type the password: ~~beetroot~~
>>Wrong!
>>Type the password: ~~carrot~~
>>Right!
>>
>>The secret is: jryy qbar!
>>```
>>
>> The program will be done in three steps.
>>
>> #### Exercise while-loop-1.1: Asking for the password
>> The initial exercise template defines the variable `String password` with a value of `carrot`. Do not change this password! You should make the program ask the user to enter a password and then compare it with the value in the variable `password`. Remember what that there is a special way to compare strings!
>>
>>```output
>>Type the password: ~~turnip~~
>>Wrong!
>>```
>>
>>```output
>>Type the password: ~~carrot~~
>>Right!
>>```
>>
>>```output
>>Type the password: ~~potato~~
>>Wrong!
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise while-loop-1.2: Asking for the password until the user gives the correct one
>>
>> Modify the program so that it asks the user to type a password until it gets the correct one. Implement this using a `while-true` loop statement. The loop statement can be interrupted if and only if the entered password matches the value of the `password` variable.
>>
>>```output
>>Type the password: ~~turnip~~
>>Wrong!
>>Type the password: ~~beetroot~~
>>Wrong!
>>Type the password: ~~carrot~~
>>Right!
>>```
>>
>> #### Exercise while-loop-1.3: Secret message
>>
>> Add your own secret message to the program and show it to the user when the password is correct. Your message can be whatever you want!
>>
>>```output
>>Type the password: ~~turnip~~
>>Wrong!
>>Type the password: ~~beetroot~~
>>Wrong!
>>Type the password: ~~carrot~~
>>Right!
>>
>>The secret is: jryy qbar!
>>```
>>
>> The secret above has been encrypted using the [Rot13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rot13) algorithm. During this course we will implement our own encryption program.
