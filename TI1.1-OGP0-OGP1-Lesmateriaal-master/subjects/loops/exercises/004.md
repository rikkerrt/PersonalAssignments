>>### Challenge loops-4 : Pythagorean triples
>>
>>**This challenge is aimed at students who are experienced in programming and have completed all exercises**
>>
>>A *Pythagorean triple* is a combination of three numbers (a, b and c) for which the following equation is true:
>>
>>  a&sup2; + b&sup2; = c&sup2;
>>
>>In other words, the Pythagorean theorem holds for these three numbers. An example would be the triple 3, 4, 5 since 3&sup2; + 4&sup2; = 5&sup2;.
>>
>>Pythagorean triples can be discovered in various ways using a computer:
>>
>>- Brute force search: try each possible combination of a, b and c and check each time if a&sup2; + b&sup2; = c&sup2;
>>- Choose positive integer numbers m and n with m > n and calculate a, b and c using these equations:
>>
>>      a = m&sup2; - n&sup2;
>>
>>      b = 2mn
>>
>>      c = m&sup2; + n&sup2;
>>
>>      Verify for yourself that for these values a&sup2; + b&sup2; = c&sup2;

>>Here is the challenge:
>>
>>1. Construct an algorithm that finds the single Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) for which a + b + c = 1000. There is exactly one such triple.
>>
>>      1. Create a flowchart of the algorithm in LARP and test the algorithm.
>>      2. Which values for a, b and c do you find (with a < b < c)?
>>
>>2. Change the algorithm (and its flowchart in LARP) so that it finds *each* Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) for any freely selectable sum a + b + c
>>      - If you choose 1000 as this sum, you get the values (a, b, c) from 1.
>>
>>3. Which Pythagorean triple do you find using this algorithm for these sums:
>>
>>      1. a + b + c = 2288 &rarr; a, b, c = ... (there is more than one triple!)
>>
>>      2. a + b + c = 3210 &rarr; a, b, c = ... (one triple, or maybe several?)
>>
>>4. Check your work with other students who have done this challenge. Verify the answers using a calculator.
>>
>>5. Creat a vlog (video presentation) in which you explain to fellow students how the algorithm works and which values for a, b and c are found.
