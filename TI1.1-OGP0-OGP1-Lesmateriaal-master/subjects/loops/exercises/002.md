>>### Exercise loops-2 : Count vowels in a sentence
>>
>>1. Imagine what an algorithm should look like that counts the number of vowels in a given sentence (i.e. a sequence of letters, digits and special symbols).
>>      - Create a flowchart of this algorithm; test it first on paper, then enter it in LARP.
>>      - Turn it into a module in LARP that receives the sentence as a string parameter and returns the number of vowels as its return value.
>>      - Create a MAIN module in LARP that lets the user enter a sentence, calls your vowel counting module and displays the result.
>>      - Create a table of test sentences, test your algorithm with these sentences and write down the results.
>>
>>2. Compare your flowchart with that of other (groups of) students. Test each other's algorithms and discuss the results.
>>
>>Useful LARP functions for this exercise:
>>
>>`LENGTH(string variable)` returns the length of the string (i.e. the number of characters in the string)
>>
>>`SUBSET(string variable, position, 1)` returns 1 character on the given position in the string
>>
>>`LOWERCASE(string variable)` returns the string with all characters converted from UPPERCASE to lowercase
>>
>>`SEPARATOR `` ` ` `` `converts the separator symbol to whatever is between `` ` ` `` to allow the user to enter spaces in the sentences
