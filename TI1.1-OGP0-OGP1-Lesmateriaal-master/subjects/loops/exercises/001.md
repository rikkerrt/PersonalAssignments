>>### Exercise loops-1 : Calculate DIN paper sizes
>>
>>Our starting point are the dimensions of paper size A0: 1189 x 841 mm (length x width)
>>
>>Each new (smaller) paper size Ax+1 can be obtained from the dimensions of the previous (larger) paper size Ax in the following way:
>>-The length of Ax+1 is equal to the width of Ax
>>-The width of Ax+1 is equal to half the length of Ax (round down to an integer value)
>>-The surface area of Ax+1 is therefore half the surface area of Ax
>>
>>So:
>>A1 = 841 mm x 1189 * 1/2 mm = 841 mm x 594 mm
>>A2 = 594 mm x 841 * 1/2 mm = 594 mm x 420 mm
>>A3 = ... etc.
>>
>>1. Create an algorithm to calculate the DIN paper sizes
>>      - First sketch the flowchart by hand on (DIN) paper
>>      - Then build the flowchart in LARP
>>      - Create a table containing the data types and meaning of all variables
>>      - Have your algorithm calculate the  dimensions for A0 through A10
>>      - Have your algorithm print out those dimensions in columns
>>
>>        |Size|Length(mm)|Width(mm)|Area(mm2)|
>>        |----|----------|---------|---------|
>>        |A0|1189|841|999949|
>>        |A1|841|594|499554|
>>        |A2|594|420| |
>>        |A3|420| | |
>>
>>2. Starting from which paper size is the surface area smaller than 100 mm2?
>>Explain how you arrive at this answer.
>>*(Searching the Internet for the answer is not the proper way to do it ;-))*
>>
>>3. Change the flowchart from the previous step into a **module** in LARP with two parameters:
>>
>>      `DINPaperDimensions(startNumber, endNumber)`
>>This module should print the required columns with size, length, width and area.
>>The output starts with the dimensions for the startNumber (0 or higher).
>>The output ends with the dimensions for the endNumber (>= startNumber).
>>The module should not return a value, only print out the answers.
>>
>>      `CALL DINPaperDimensions(0, 10)` produces the output from step 1.
>>
>>      `CALL DINPaperDimensions(3, 6)` produces the dimensions of A3 through A6
>>
>>      `CALL DINPaperDimensions(4, 3)` doesn't produce any output because 3 < 4
