>>#### gui-extra-3.1 Create the GUI
>>
>> The first step is to create a similar GUI as shown the picture above.
>>* Add a `ComboBox` and use the excisting `ObservableList skillList`.
>>* Create a `Button` with the text *Add skill*
>>* Add a `ListView` with no items attached to it, but you have to bind it on `ObservableList<String> realizedSkills`
>>* Create a `Button` with the text *Remove skill*
>>
>>#### gui-extra-3.2 Implement the functionality
>>
>> The next step is to implement the functionality to our program. The behavior of the program should be:
>>* When pressing on the `Button` *Add skill*, the selected skill in the `ComboBox` should be copied in the `ListView`.
>>* When pressing on the `Button` *Remove skill*, the skill selected in the `ListView` should be deleted.
>> Make sure that your program will not crash if no items are selected and that no duplicate items will appear in the `ListView`
