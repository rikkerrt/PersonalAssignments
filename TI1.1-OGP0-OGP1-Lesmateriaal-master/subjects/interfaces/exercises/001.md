>> ### Exercise interfaces-1: NationalService
>>
>> In the exercise layout, you find the premade interface NationalService, which contains the following operations:
>>* `public int getDaysLeft()` which returns the number of days left on service
>>* `public void work()`, which reduces the working days by one. The working days number can not become negative.
>> ```java
>>public interface NationalService {
>>    int getDaysLeft();
>>    void work();
>>}
>> ```
>>
>>#### Exercise interfaces-1.1: CivilService
>>
>>Create the class `CivilService` which implements your `NationalService` interface. The class constructor is without parameter. The class has the object variable daysLeft which is initialised in the constructor receiving the value *362*.
>>
>>#### Exercise interfaces-1.2: MilitaryService
>> Create the class `MilitaryService` which implements your `NationalService` interface. The class constructor has one parameter, defining the days of service (`int daysLeft`).
