>> ### Exercise method-memory-2: Smart combining
>>
>> Create the method `smartCombine` that works like the previous `combine` method except that numbers can be on the list only once. This means that the method adds a new number to the list only if the list does not already contain that number. You might find the method `contains` from the `ArrayList` class useful. You can use that method to check if a number is in the list.
