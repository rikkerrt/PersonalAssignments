>>### Exercise 41: Drawing Board
>>
>>With the exercise body, you find a pre-made user interface, which is connected to the class `DrawingBoard`, which inherits `JPanel`. Modify the method `paintComponent` of `DrawingBoard` so that it would draw the following figure. You can only use the `fillRect` method of the `Graphics` object, in this exercise.

>>**Attention!** Do not use more than five `fillRect` calls. The figure does not have to be identical to the one above, the tests tell you when your figure is close enough to the required one.
